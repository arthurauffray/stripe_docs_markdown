## File Naming Conventions

Files and folders follow exact Stripe document titles (lowercase) with these transformations:
- **Spaces** → underscores (`_`)
- **Hyphens** → stay as hyphens (`-`)
- **Apostrophes** → underscores (`_`)
- **Underscores** in original names → wrapped by underscores (e.g., `customer_balance` → `customer__balance`)
- **Colons** → wrapped by underscores (`_:_`)

Example: `List a Customer's PaymentMethods` → `list_a_customer_s_paymentmethods.md`.
Note: Each section folder contains an intro file with the same name as the folder (e.g., `/refunds/refunds.md`).

## Developer Guide for LLMs

When using this documentation to write code, solve bugs, analyse projects, or plan integrations, follow these protocols:

### 1. Planning & Exploration
- **Start with Intros**: Before implementing an endpoint, read the section's intro file (e.g., `docs/billing/subscriptions/subscriptions.md`) to understand the lifecycle and state transitions.
- **Understand Core Concepts**: Review `docs/introduction/` for critical global behavior like `authentication.md`, `pagination.md`, and `expanding_responses.md`.

### 2. Implementation & Coding
- **Object Definitions**: Always verify the response structure by reading the `the_[object_name]_object.md` file in the relevant section. This ensures you use the correct fields.
- **Param Validation**: Use the specific endpoint files (e.g., `create_a_customer.md`) to identify required vs. optional parameters and their types.
- **Multi-Language Snippets**: Most files include snippets for Python, Node.js, Go, etc. Prefer these over generic logic to ensure compatibility with Stripe's SDKs. You may also have a single language version of the docs.

### 3. Debugging & Troubleshooting
- **Error Codes**: Consult `docs/introduction/errors.md` to map API error codes to specific failure reasons and recovery strategies.
- **Event Types**: For webhook issues, find the `*_event_types.md` files (e.g., `docs/core_resources/accounts/account_event_types.md`) to understand payload structures.
- **Idempotency**: If dealing with timeouts or duplicate requests, refer to `docs/introduction/idempotent_requests.md`.

### 4. Search Protocol
- If you are unsure where an endpoint lives, use global search for the endpoint name (e.g., `grep -r "v1/invoices" docs/`).
- If a concept is mentioned but not detailed, check `structure.md` to see where relevant files might be located.

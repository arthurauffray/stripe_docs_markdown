# Country Specs

Stripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.

You can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/required-verification-information.md).

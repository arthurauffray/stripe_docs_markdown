# Reserves

Reserves allow Connect platforms who own liability for negative balances to hold a portion of a connected account’s funds to cover refunds and disputes and reduce loss exposure. The Reserves feature is part of the Radar for Platforms product which is currently in private preview. See [this page to request early access](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-for-platforms.md).
